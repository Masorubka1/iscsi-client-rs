# Contributing


We welcome contributions! To enable a future dual‑licensing path while keeping the repo AGPL‑only today, we require:


1. **DCO sign‑off** on every commit:
Add a line to each commit message:
`Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>`


2. **CLA** before your first pull request:
Individuals: sign `CLA-INDIVIDUAL.md`.
Companies: sign `CLA-ENTITY.md`.


The CLA grants the project maintainers the right to relicense *your contributions* in addition to AGPL (e.g., to a commercial license) without re‑contacting you, while you retain full rights to your own code.


By contributing, you certify that you wrote the code or have the right to submit it and that it is provided under AGPL‑3.0‑or‑later to this project.
